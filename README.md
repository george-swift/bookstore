## Objectives

- Unit testing a React and Redux application
- Functional Programming
- Meeting model client requirements

## Features
Bookstore CMS is a book management app that implements a model design spec. Each book has a title and belongs to some category. Users can add a book to the store by filling in the title and selecting a category in the form. To delete a book from _Bookstore CMS_ simply click on `Remove`. Above the books, the category filter displays books for a given category and by default is `All`. Toggling the dropdown filters book by selected category. To add author and reading progress to a book in the list, click on `Edit` or `Update Progress`. Adding comments, managing categories and user authentication will be available in subsequent implementations. This app is hosted on Heroku.
